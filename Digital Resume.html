      <!--Detailed introduction about myself-->

        Hi! I'm Kelsy a 21 year old who loves anime and designing.I'm quite shy when we first meet and I'll barely utter more than two words,but once I've established that I can be comfortable with you and i am able to trust you , you would not be able to keep me from talking.
        I'm great at working in teams and as long as my opinion is respected I will respect yours as well.I tend to however work alone.I'm very determined and I'll always give it my best when a task is given to me .I'm also always willing to learn and grow to become the best version of myself.
